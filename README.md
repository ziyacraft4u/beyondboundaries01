# Cricket Tournament — Static Site

This repository contains a minimal static site for a cricket tournament.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — site styles
- `script.js` — small client scripts
- `assets/` — images and icons

Run locally (Node):
1. npm install
2. npm start

Run locally (Python):
- python -m http.server 3000
- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

Run from VS Code (Live Server):
- Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code (if not already installed).
- Open this folder in VS Code, open `index.html`, and click the "Go Live" button in the status bar to serve the site locally.

Notes:
- If you don't have Node or Python installed, using the Live Server extension is the easiest way to preview the site.
